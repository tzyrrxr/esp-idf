Current GPIO is for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} beta3 version. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} MP version would have 2 more available IOs, and some pin functions are changed. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} MP version will be updated later.

The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip features 27 physical GPIO pins (GPIO0 ~ GPIO26). Each pin can be used as a general-purpose I/O, or to be connected to an internal peripheral signal. Through GPIO matrix and IO MUX, peripheral input signals can be from any IO pins, and peripheral output signals can be routed to any IO pins. Together these modules provide highly configurable I/O. For more details, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *IO MUX and GPIO Matrix (GPIO, IO_MUX)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#iomuxgpio>`__].

The table below provides more information on pin usage, and please note the comments in the table for GPIOs with restrictions.

.. note::

    - Strapping pin: GPIO2, GPIO3, GPIO6, and GPIO7 are strapping pins. For more infomation, please refer to `datasheet <{IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL}>`__.
	  - SPI0/1: GPIO18-24 are usually used for SPI flash and not recommended for other uses.
	  - USB-JTAG: GPIO 25 and 26 are used by USB-JTAG by default. In order to use them as GPIOs, USB-JTAG will be disabled by the drivers.
